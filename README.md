# Readme-Gen
Script that can generate a readme file.

## Folder Structure 🗺️:
- Inside the "readme-test" folder you'll find:
    - "README_TEST.md" which is a test of what the "readme_gen.js" script can create.
- Also, inside the node_modules folder you'll find tons of scripts that can be used when using Node JS. for this project I only used "inquirer" module.
